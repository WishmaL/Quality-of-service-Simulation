%Usage example:
%   q = queue;   %creates a queue with default initial capacity (1000 elements. grows as needed).
%   q.enqueue(struct('id', 1, 'value, 'aaa'));
%   q.enqueue([2 3 4 5 6]);
%   while q.Depth > 0
%       disp('element dequeued:');
%       disp(q.dequeue);
%   end
%
%Properties of the queue class:
%   - Depth: number of elements currently stored in the queue
%
%Methods of the class:
%   - qobj.enqueue(element): store one element in the queue
%   - element = qobj.dequeue: remove one element from the queue
%
%Static methods of the class:
%   - qarr = queue.MakeVectorOfQueues(sz): construct an array of distinct queues.
%Note that queue is a handle class.

        Bounds;   %Bounds(1) is the index of the start of the queue, Bounds(2) is the index one past the end of the queue (insertion point). Indices are 0-based.
